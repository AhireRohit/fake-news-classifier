A Republican plan backed by Trump to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system was pulled on Friday after it failed to garner enough support to pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Trump, a Republican, did not mention that failure at the reception nor did he offer specifics on how he planned for lawmakers to reach a consensus on a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, familiarly known as Obamacare.  Trump told lawmakers at the reception that he would be talking about infrastructure and investing in the military, without offering a time frame or details. \\u201cHopefully, it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. We want greatness for this country that we love,\\u201d he said. \",\n          \"TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Air China Ltd has indefinitely suspended flights between Beijing and Pyongyang, citing poor demand as North Korea faces growing sanctions from the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs. An official in the company s Beijing-based press office, who only gave his surname as Ding, told Reuters on Wednesday that flights were suspended because  business was not good . He declined to comment on when flights might resume. The suspension by China s national flag carrier comes shortly after a visit by a senior Chinese envoy to the city and also coincides with a U.S. decision to put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism. Air China flights to Pyongyang, which have traditionally operated on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, began in 2008, but have frequently been canceled because of unspecified problems, state media has said.  Last year, Air China halted flights seasonally for winter but resumed them in March. So far it is not selling tickets for any 2018 flights, according to Routes Online. One staff member in the company s Pyongyang office who declined to give his name told Reuters that Air China can resume the flights whenever there is enough demand and the office will operate normally even while there are no scheduled flights between Beijing and Pyongyang.  Air China s Beijing-based press office declined to provide further comment.  The company canceled some flights in April but later said that it would increase their number in May. The United States has urged China to do more to press North Korea to stop what the United States sees as belligerent defiance of U.N. resolutions. China s foreign ministry on Tuesday said that it hoped all parties could contribute to resolving the issue on the Korean peninsula peacefully. It also said that it was not aware of the Air China situation, adding that airlines made their decisions based on market needs. \",\n          \"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian opposition lawmaker Tundu Lissu, a fierce critic of President John Magufuli s government, was seriously wounded in a gun attack on Thursday, police and party officials said. Magufuli condemned the shooting and ordered the country s security forces to investigate the incident. Lissu underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the abdomen and other parts of the body by unknown gunmen outside his residence in the administrative capital Dodoma, they said.  Lissu has suffered multiple gunshot wounds and is being treated at the main public hospital in Dodoma,  said Tumaini Makene, spokesman for the main opposition CHADEMA party.  We strongly condemn this attack and are closely monitoring his condition,  the party said in a separate statement. James Kiologwe, a doctor at Dodoma regional hospital, said Lissu was in stable condition. Police said an investigation had been launched into the attack on Lissu, a senior lawyer and CHADEMA s parliamentary chief whip. Police said they did not know what had motivated the attack and the suspects were still at large.  I have been saddened by reports of the shooting of Hon. Tundu Lissu. I pray for his quick recovery,  Magufuli said on Twitter.  Law enforcement agencies should hunt down all those involved in this barbaric act and bring them to justice.  Lissu is a vocal opponent of Magufuli and has been arrested on several occasions and charged with incitement. He was detained most recently in July after having called Magufuli a dictator. He was subsequently released.  The authorities must take steps to reassure Tanzanians and the world that this shooting was not politically motivated,  rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"REAL\",\n          \"FAKE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"isot\",\n          \"liar\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/fake-news-classifier/data/processed/all_cleaned_news.csv\")\n","print(df.shape)\n","df.head()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"69447632","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"69447632","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751208641004,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"James Bond","userId":"18044602596662373875"}},"outputId":"946ede6f-5117-471d-b13c-23a2d389e328"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(55138, 3)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}],"source":["df.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"b4f96b02","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"id":"b4f96b02","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1751208642019,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":33,"user":{"displayName":"James Bond","userId":"18044602596662373875"}},"outputId":"2158648c-68e8-4fbf-f491-6ae13a86a8b0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<bound method DataFrame.info of                                                     text label source\n","0      Says the Annies List political group supports ...
